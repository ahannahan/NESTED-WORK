           <h3><li> 4.55 avg rating—521,085 ratings </li> </h3>
            

            <p><strong> Not surprisingly, the seven novels in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series take up the top spots among best-rated books on Goodreads.  Fittingly, the first novel, 
            Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, which introduces us to Harry, his muggle relatives, and his beginnings at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, is the highest-rated book on the site: 
            it has earned a 4.46-star rating (out of 5) from an average of 5.5 million (yes, million) ratings. Additional novels in the series have ratings of 4.35 and up, with an average of 2 million reviews.
             Harry Potter fans of all ages might be intrigued by these hidden messages in the books.</strong> </p><hr>

             <ul><h2><u> THE NAME OF THE WIND  BY PATRICK ROTHFUSS</u></h2></ul>
                <h3><li> 4.55 avg rating—521,085 ratings </li></h3>
                
               <p><strong> Another epic fantasy told from the viewpoint of a wizard turned…bartender? Fans describe it as addictive, beautifully written, and inventive. 
                Most of Rothfuss’s other novels are just as highly rated, including the sequel to this book, The Wise Man’s.</strong></p> <hr>

          <h2><u>THE LAST OLYMPIAN  BY RICK RIORDAN</u></h2>
            <h3><li> 4.5 avg rating—539,901 ratings </li></h3>

           <p><strong> Whether you think of this book as a YA or MG fantasy, Riordan deserves to be on a list of top rated Goodreads books. He’s won the GR Choice Awards more times
            than any other writer—seven since 2011—and every book he’s written rates above an average of four starThe Last Olympian is the highest rated book in his Percy Jackson series at 4.5.
            mentioned before, the vast majority of the books above are fantasy, either of the YA or adult variety. So we decided to expand our list to include a few other popular.</strong></p><hr>

            <h2><u> HOPELESS  BY COLLEEN HOOVER</u></h2>
            <h3><li> 4.33 avg rating—367,809 ratings </li></h3>

            <p><strong> TBH, I would have been shocked if Hoover wasn’t the author of Goodread’s highest rated romance.
             She’s a perennial Goodreads Choice Awards nominee and winner, and her emotional new adult romances have a super-loyal fanbase.</strong>></p><hr>

             <h2><u> A BRIEF HISTORY OF HUMANKIND BY YUVAL NOAH HARARI</u></h2>
             <h3><li>4.45 avg rating—136,877 ratings</li></h3>
             <p><strong>4.45 is a very high rating for non-fiction on Goodreads, which is somewhat comforting in that it suggests people are engaging critically with their non-fiction content.
                 In Sapiens, Harari tells the story of how humans became what we are, starting with our prehistoric roots and ending with a view to the future. Most people call this book enlightening 
                 and informative, although some accuse Harari of being, “biased against humans and society” and not offering proper evidence to support his claims. You decide!</strong></p>
